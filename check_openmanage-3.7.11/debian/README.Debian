check-openmanage for Debian
---------------------------

If want to install Dell OpenManage Server Administrator on some of
your Debian servers, take a look at the work done by SARA Reken- en
Netwerkdiensten: https://subtrac.sara.nl/oss/omsa_2_deb

Here is an old page from Dell also pointing to the work done by
sara.nl: http://linux.dell.com/debian_9g.shtml
